This is my clone of the codepen.io homepage. The original site is built with **React** but I'm doing mine with just HTML & CSS.

#### Pending Changes
- [] Fix arrows
- [] Add the user works' section
- [] Add the editor section
- [] Add the sidebar
- [] Add the yellow PRO tag
- [] Add the animated text
- [] Sort the issue with the colour of the footer list
- [] Use media queries

_I started this list late into my project, so that's why it looks so short_ ðŸ’€
